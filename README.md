# Whisperstorm

This is my personal web space. It will have all kinds of random things. It's not a blog, but a garden. 

For inspiration see: [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

I want to find a way to capture all of my ideas, creations, writings, and information into one site. This is it! 

Whisperstorm is also the name for my shared universe of stories, creations, etc. This site will be a prototype of the site you can create with MajiBuilder.
